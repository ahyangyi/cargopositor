# Cargopositor

Cargopositor is a tools that takes these MagicaVoxel files:

![Before.](./img/truck_before.png)

And produces these as output:

![After.](./img/truck_after.png)

If you create sprites using [GoRender](https://github.com/mattkimber/gorender)
then it will be obvious why this is useful. Cargopositor saves the need to
draw and edit multiple vehicle objects for different cargo graphics, making
it easier and quicker to create sprites and update them.
